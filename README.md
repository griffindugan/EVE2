# EVE2
This was the second pilot study for EVE. It was designed to create a program that could display a visual on a screen, while playing sound and tracking eye movements with an Eyelink eye tracker. This project has since been halted, so the code is not finalised.

To analyse the data, the previous pilot study (EVE1)'s analysis program was used.

The program was built to display a moving dot that moved around the screen randomly for the participant to track with their eyes while playing a recorded passage. This was one condition, as the other was simply a stationary dot. This was built off the dual-task paradigm. 

## WARNING
This program likely will not run correctly due to missing files. If you would like to see how it works, please reach out to me.
